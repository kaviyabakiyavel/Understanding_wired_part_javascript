//Types and operators
//Difference b/w static typed and dynamic typed language
//Static typed language - java , c ,c++ once variable declared , variables can be identified on Complie time
//Dynamic typed language - Javascript , python . variables can be identified on run time.

//1) Static typed Langauges - 
//Variables are declared with datatypes as these languages are compiled by a compiler before execution.
//Because of compiler "Optimized Code" and slower development cycle.
//Eg: 
//bool isNew = 'hello' ; //an error


//Dynamically typed language 
//Variable type is not declared 
//And hence these languages usually dont have a compiler but have an interpreter that checks for type at the time of program excution .
//Because of interpreter "Less Optimized code" and Faster Development Cycle .
//Eg:
var isNew = true ; //no errors
isNew = 'yup';
isNew = 1;


//so javascript is dynamically typed . it figures it out on the fly.
